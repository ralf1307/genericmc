GenericMC
=========

GenericMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft forked from [MultiMC 5](https://multimc.org) that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

### Building
If you want to build GenericMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.


## Translations
Translations can be currently done upstream. At some point it's going to get forked too.
